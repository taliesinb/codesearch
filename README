Information about this fork:

This fork is adds some small features to make it easier to skip certain file 
extensions, to find out why certain files are exceeding the trigram limits, 
to localize the causes of skipping in large files, to produce null-delimited 
output, and to bypass some problematic content that is typical in Mathematica 
notebook files which prevent them from being indexed in many cases.

I'm not quite sure how to check this as a fork but still have the hard-coded
package URLs resolve properly, I merely followed the instructions at 
http://blog.campoy.cat/2014/03/github-and-go-forking-pull-requests-and.html
to get it working locally for me. 

I suspect one might have to check out the original repo, then 
"git remote add fork https://github.com/taliesinb/codesearch; git pull fork".
